# NodeExpress-Session

This project contains NodeJS + Express + Express-Session - server and client side.
on the client side - Includes html + js + JQuery + css + bootstrap.
on the Server side - we have Express-Session feature with Active/Inactive Status and this manages the user connection
( by Cookies ).

Instructions:

1) First, the App is Listening port 3000 on localhost, so after running NodeJS in the root folder with "npx nodemon" Command, open Chrome and go to "localhost:3000" to get started.
2) the Build-in Admin is a user named "admin" with password "1234" ( and Cannot be deleted ).
3) i dont use "Passport" for an Authentication method, i create my own code with the internal Express-session libary.
4) for each user after login screen, we have Proxy as a Code and that Naviagte the user to Administration Page or all Users Page - Defined by Role.
5) in Every move we have alerts on the screen
6) NO DataBase is require (Meanwhile..)
